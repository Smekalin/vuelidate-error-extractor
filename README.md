**Vuelidate-error-extractor** makes error message display from vuelidate a breeze. Be it for a single form element or all displaying all the errors in a form.

## Key features
* Easy to use
* Flexible - can be tailored to fit your needs
* With or without extra markup - yey **mixins** and **slots**!!!
* No styling mucking your own
* Tested

Error messages can be styled to fit either [Foundation 6](http://foundation.zurb.com/sites/docs/forms.html) and [Bootstrap 3](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.3/css/#forms) styles out of the box, or can be totally customized via templates provided by the user.

Vuelidate-error-extractor is also able to work with [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n) or any vue translation plugin as long as it exposes a `$t` function to the Vue prototype. We also support predefining custom validation messages for all components and overriding them per component.
