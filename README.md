This library eases the pain of showing vuelidate error messages in your websites. It was at first made to work with Laravel and Vue-i18n, but can be configured to work with what you wish. 

By registering a `form-group` component, it automatically shows all the errors. The plugin can be configured to work with Foundation and Bootstrap, as well as custom templates provided by the user.

The plugin is also able to work with [vue-i18n](https://github.com/kazupon/vue-i18n) or without it by providing custom validation messages for all components or per component.
